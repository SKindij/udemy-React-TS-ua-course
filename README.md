### Vite - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
_Get ready for a development environment that can finally catch up with you._

It consists of two major parts:
* dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules;
* build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

> 1. install Vite globally by running following command:\
>  &emsp; &emsp;``npm install -g create-vite``
> 2. run following command to create new Vite project with React and TypeScript:\
>  &emsp; &emsp;`create-vite mastering-react --template react-ts``\
>  _this  will create new folder called "mastering-react" with initial Vite project structure_
> 3. navigate to the newly created project folder:\
>  &emsp; &emsp;``cd mastering-react``
> 4. then we execute such commands:\
>   &emsp; &emsp;``npm install`` and ``npm run dev``
